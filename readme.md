# StudienarbeitCode

This repository contains code for generating surrogate models for CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer) joints. The workflow includes:

- **Data Generation:** Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations using Abaqus.
- **Modeling:** Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Kriging models for surrogate modeling.

## Usage

1. Run FEM simulations in Abaqus to generate data.
2. Apply RSM and Kriging techniques to build surrogate models.

## Requirements

- Abaqus (for FEM simulations)
- Python (for data processing and modeling)
